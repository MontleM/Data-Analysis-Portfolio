<h2>Project 1: Data Analysis with HealthCare</h2>

A nationwide survey of hospital costs conducted by the US Agency for Healthcare consists of hospital records of inpatient samples. The given data is restricted to the city of Wisconsin and relates to patients in the age group 0-17 years. The agency wants to analyze the data to research on the healthcare costs and their utilization.

Here is a detailed description of the given dataset:<br>
AGE : Age of the patient discharged<br>
FEMALE : Binary variable that indicates if the patient is female<br>
LOS : Length of stay, in days<br>
RACE : Race of the patient (specified numerically)<br>
TOTCHG : Hospital discharge costs<br>
APRDRG : All Patient Refined Diagnosis Related Groups<br>

<h2>Project 2: Data Analysis with Cities</h2>

Imagine you are already working as a DiDi operations intern and you have been asked to
perform some data analysis on 3 cities; Riyadh, Munich and Panama City. The goal is to help
your team to better understand the current situation in each city so that we can better plan and
execute strategies that will yield better operational results. Specifically, your team want to know:<br>

1. What is the Driver ID of the driver who has completed the most trips?<br>
2. Which city has the highest average trips per Driver?<br>
3. Which month had the 3rd lowest number of signups in Munich?<br>

<h2>Project 3: Eskom Data Anaysis with Python</h2>

<h2>Project 4: Data Analysis with Insurance</h2>

The data gives the details of third party motor insurance claims in Sweden for the year 1977. In Sweden, all motor insurance companies apply identical risk arguments to classify customers, and thus their portfolios and their claims statistics can be combined. The data were compiled by a Swedish Committee on the Analysis of Risk Premium in Motor Insurance. The Committee was asked to look into the problem of analyzing the real influence on the claims of the risk arguments and to compare this structure with the actual tariff.

<h2>Project 5: EDSA Apple Prices Challenge</h2>


<h4>Challenge Description</h4>
Imagine you are in the Fresh Produce Industry. How much stock do you have on hand? Not too little that you run out of stock when customers want to buy more. And not too much that food waste occurs. How do you set your prices? Yields from farms fluctuate by season. Should your prices then also fluctuate by season?

With this context, EDSA is challenging you to construct a regression algorithm, capable of accurately predicting how much a kilogram of Golden Delicious Apples will cost, given certain parameters.

Providing an accurate and robust solution to this challenge has immense economic potential, with users of the system being able to accurately determine how much stock to have on hand and what price to set the Golden Delicious Apples to.
