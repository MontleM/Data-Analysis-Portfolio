<h2>Project 2: Data Analysis with Cities</h2>

Imagine you are already working as a DiDi operations intern and you have been asked to
perform some data analysis on 3 cities; Riyadh, Munich and Panama City. The goal is to help
your team to better understand the current situation in each city so that we can better plan and
execute strategies that will yield better operational results. Specifically, your team want to know:<br>

1. What is the Driver ID of the driver who has completed the most trips?<br>
2. Which city has the highest average trips per Driver?<br>
3. Which month had the 3rd lowest number of signups in Munich?<br>
